<h2> Arteries and Veins  </h2>
 <p> The heart pumps blood through blood vessels known as arteries and veins. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart (arteries, away, a- away), while
 veins carry blood to the heart. An important artery is the aorta, sending oxygenated blood to the rest of your body. Veins carry blood back to the heart, going through the atria and ventricles
  and then out the arteries. Well known veins are the superior and inferior vena cava, which take in deoxygenated blood to later be send to the lungs. </p>

  <p>Arteries are actually thicker than veins, having to handle a more forceful push from the ventricles. The aorta is the thickest artery, having to sustain the pressure directly 
  from the left ventricle. The left ventricle is thicker than the right, having to send blood to the rest of the body whereas the right just has to send blood to the lungs. 
  This is actually why your heart is on the left side of your chest. This increased pressure has to be compensated by the thickening of the aorta. </p>

 <p>Blood vessels actually lead to smaller blood vessels and capillaries, a system called microcirculation. This includes smaller arteries and veins, called arterioles and venules, respectively. 
 Arterioles are smaller than arteries, better at maintiaining higher blood pressure for flow, going through capillaries, the site of nutrient and gas exchange, and then to venules. Venules
 lead to bigger veins, which are better suited for more blood flowing back to the heart. Veins also have valves that prevent the blood from flowing back away from the heart. </p>
