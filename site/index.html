<h1> The Cardiovascular System! </h1>
  <p> This page is going to be about the cardiovascular system. It's going to go into heart anatomy, your arteries and veins, and finally your capillaries. </p>
  <p>The cardiovascular system is responsible for sending blood throughout your body to ensure that your organs are functioning. Red blood cells carry a protein called
  hemoglobin which binds to oxygen. This oxygen is necessary for cells to end aerobic cellular respiration. </p>
  <p> This is an overview from what I remember from studying last year lol, if you want to learn more about the body definitely read Vander's Human Physiology, it's a long 
  textbook about the body. </p>
