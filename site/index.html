  <p>The cardiovascular system is responsible for sending blood throughout your body to ensure that your organs are functioning. Red blood cells carry a protein called
  hemoglobin which binds to oxygen. This oxygen is necessary for cells to end aerobic cellular respiration. </p>

  <p> This is an overview from what I remember from studying last year lol. I encourage you to do more research about the heart, and
  other parts of our body in general. </p>
