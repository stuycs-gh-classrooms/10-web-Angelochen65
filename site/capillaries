<h2> Capillaries </h2>

<p> What is the point of pumping blood through the body? Why is it necessary? Capilarries where blood does its work, exchanging oxygen and nutrients with the 
organs in your body so that they can function. </p>

<p> Capillaries are really small in diameter, so blood has a hard time flowin through them quickly. This is so that the oxygen and nutrients have more time to diffuse out of 
the capillary and into your organs. </p>

<p> Capillaries look like little webs that start with small arterioles and end with venules. </p>
