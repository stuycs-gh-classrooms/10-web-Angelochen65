<h2> Capillaries </h2>

<p> What is the point of pumping blood through the body? Why is it necessary? Capilarries where blood does its work, exchanging oxygen and nutrients with the 
organs in your body so that they can function. </p>

<p> Capillaries are really small in diameter, so blood has a hard time flowing through them quickly. This is so that the oxygen and nutrients have more time to diffuse out of 
the capillary and into your organs. </p>

 <p> There are many forces that determine if there is more filtration or reabsorption in the capillaries. The high pressure of the capillaries (remember that there is a small radius, thus there is high pressure)
  leads to more filtration, since pressure wants to go from high to low to balance things out. The amount of protein outside of the capillaries also favors filtration, remember that osmosis 
  drives water to where there are more solutes. Similarly, the pressure outside of the capillaries and the protein concentration inside of the capillaries drive reabsorption. 

<p> Capillaries look like little webs that start with small arterioles and end with venules. </p>
