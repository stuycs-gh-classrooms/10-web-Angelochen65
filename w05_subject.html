<h2> The Heart </h2>

<p> The heart is a big muscle located in your heart responsible for pumping blood through the rest of your body. It is responsible for sending blood to your organs.
The diaram above shows a basic anatomy of the heart. The blue parts show the path that deoxygenated blood from th  rest ofuo (blood in need of oxygen) goes through the heart, to the lungs.
Whereas the red parts show the path that oxygenated blood go through the heart to the rest of the body (not lungs)</p>
<p> Deoxygenated blood flow through the top and bottom vena cava, or the superior and inferior vena cava, where they arrive in the right atrium. The heart is drawn in <thead>
  perspective of the physician, so what looks like it's on the left is actually on the right side of the heart. The blood flows from the atrium to the right ventricle, through
the tricuspid valve, into the right ventricle, through the pulmonaryoary valve, and then through the pulmonary arteries, to the lungs.  </p>

<p> Meanwhile, oxygenated blood receives blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins, arriving to the right atrium. Then, the blood goes through the Tricuspid Valve into the left ventricle. \
  then through the aortic valve, then flowing to the rest of your organs (not your lungs). </p>

  <p> The right side of the heart (the blue part) is referred to as the pulmonary circuit because it sends blood to the lungs. The left side of the heart (the red part) is called
    the systemic circuit, sending blood to the other parts of the heart. The left and right parts of the heart are separated by the septum. </p>
