<h2> The Heart </h2>
<img src="https://post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/2232666-What-is-heart-block_1296x1018-body-1024x805.png">
<p> The heart is a big muscle located in your heart responsible for pumping blood
  through the rest of your body. It is responsible for sending blood to your organs.
The diaram above shows a basic anatomy of the heart. The blue parts show the path 
  that deoxygenated blood from th  rest ofuo (blood in need of oxygen) goes through the heart, to the lungs.
Whereas the red parts show the path that oxygenated blood go through the heart to the rest of the body (not lungs)</p>

<p> The heart has many components that makes it an effective pump of blood, which 
  is necessary to transport oxygen to use in cellular respiration. </p>

  <h2>Atria and Ventricles </h2>
  <p> The heart is separated into 4 chambers. The top chambers are made up by the left and right atrium, and the bottom 
  chambers are made of the left and right ventricles. </p>
  <p>Blood first arrives through the veins into the atrium, then the blood flows through valves (so that blood does not blackflow) 
  into the ventricles, where again they go through valves then either go to different parts of the body. The right
    side of the heart (our left, blue side) sends blood to the lungs to give them oxygen. The left side of the heart 
  (the one on our right, the red) is responsible for sending blood with oxygen to the rest of the body. </p>

  <h2>Arteries and Veins </h2>
  <p>Arteries and veins are blood vessles responsible for transporting blood </p>
  <p>Arteries carry blood AWAY from the heart (a -> away), while veins carry blood to the heart. The major artery that sends blood
  to the body is the aorta, while the pulmonary arteries send blood to the lungs. The major veins that empty into the right atrium 
  are the superior and inferior vena cava. </p>
