<p> The heart is a big muscle located in your heart responsible for pumping blood through the rest of your body. It is responsible for sending blood to your organs.
The diaram above shows a basic anatomy of the heart. The blue parts show the path that deoxygenated blood (blood in need of oxygen) goes through the heart, to the lungs.
Whereas the red parts show the path that oxygenated blood go through the heart to the rest of the body (not lungs)</p>
<p> Deoxygenated blood flow through the top and bottom vena cava, or the superior and inferior vena cava, where they arrive in the right atrium. The heart is drawn in <thead>
